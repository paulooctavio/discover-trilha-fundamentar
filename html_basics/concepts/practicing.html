    The <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong> or <strong>HTML</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be <em>displayed</em> in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
</p>

<p>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a <strong>web server</strong> or from <strong>local storage</strong> and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the <em>structure</em> of a web page <em>semantically</em> and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
