    Tag nesting

    - Flow
    - Hierarchy
    - Elements positioning

<!-- HTML elements can be nested, meaning that one element can be placed inside another element. Nesting allows you to apply multiple HTML tags to a single piece of content. -->

<p> 
    <em>text<em>
    <p>text2</p> 
</p> <!-- One has to be careful to close open tags -->

<!-- There is a flow where tags are read in order from top to bottom -->

<p> First paragraph </p>
<p> Second paragraph </p>

<!-- There are tags that break the line (eg <p></p>) and others that don't (eg <em></em>) -->

<p>
    This is a <em>text</em>
    <p>This is another text</p>
</p>

<!-- To break line inside a <p></p> tag we can use the <br> element -->

<p>
    Here we have another text <br> and here a line break
</p>
